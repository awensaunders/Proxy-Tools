# Proxy-Tools
GUI application to manage ssh tunnels (mac)
The application is feature-complete, but not fully tested. The only todo is to add a file chooser for the ssh id file. 

###Testing
Some unit tests have been included at ./tests. They can be run with py.test. The tests are also run on travis-ci, and results for each build can be viewed there.
